without master nodes? worker ndoes should be worked independently.
kubelet should be controller all their needed
'/etc/kubernetes/manifests' <- directory in worker node 
kubelet accesses file from above directory
It is able to create Static PODS. 
'kubelet.service' or 'kubeconfig.yaml'(staticPodPath) identifies their path
create pods in kubelet -> In master node, kubectl can checks pods created by kubelet
                              Static PODs vs. DaemonSets? 
                        Create by Kubelet vs. Created by Kube-API server(DaemonSet Controller)
Deploy control plane components as static pods vs. deploy monitoring agents, looing agents on nodes
